# Road_Accident_Data_Analysis_Excel_Project

Road Accident Analytics Dashboard | Microsoft Excel | Excel BI Project

Objective: To analyze accident data across vehicle types, road surfaces, and lighting conditions to identify key risk factors and areas needing safety improvement.

I built interactive Excel dashboard to analyze road accident trends across vehicle types, road conditions, and lighting environments over multiple years.

Key Insights:
• Total casualties: 417,883
• Fatal: 7,135 (1.7%)
• Serious: 59,312 (14.2%)
• Slight: 351,436 (84.1%)
• Cars were involved in nearly 80% of total casualties — indicating the highest risk among all vehicle types.
• Single carriageway roads accounted for over 74% of total casualties, making it the most accident-prone road type.
• Dry surface conditions saw the majority of incidents, suggesting driver behavior and speed may be stronger factors than road conditions alone.
• Urban areas (255.9K) recorded significantly higher accidents compared to rural regions (162K).
• Accidents were more frequent in daylight conditions (305K) than in dark conditions (112K).
• A comparison between 2021 vs 2022 shows a slight reduction in monthly casualties, indicating gradual safety improvement.
417K total casualties — 80% from car-related incidents.
• Single carriageway roads are the most accident-prone.
• Urban areas witness 60%+ of total road casualties.
• Accidents in daylight far exceed night-time incidents.
• Fatalities form only 1.7% — yet show the highest severity concentration in specific zones.

Tools Used:
• Power Query for data transformation
• Pivot Charts, Slicers & Timelines for interactivity
• KPIs and data-driven color coding for readability
